## Introduction

This web application allows you to make a travel checklist, which consists of a list of items you want to carry on a trip. You can do so by simply dragging and dropping items from a sidebar. Once youâ€™re finished with your list, you can save it for future use. Additionally you have the option to print the list or save it as a PDF if you prefer a physical copy.

## Technologies Used

- Python - version 3.11.2
- Flask
- SQLite db (sqlite3)
- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- JQuery (little bit)
- Jinja
- Bootstrap

## Features

- You can drag and drop items to make your list, and you can remove items by dragging them back to the sidebar.
- You can save your list with a name, which appears on the right side
- When you click on any one of the list names, it opens up that list for view and edit (Editing is not currently implemented)
- Click the 'Print' button to generate a specially formatted checklist
- Each item in the sidebar comes with an icon for better user experience.

## Setup and Usage

Install the required packages using `pip install requirements.txt`

Run the program by **cd**-ing into the directory and typing `flask run`

## Make-up of Program

There are main files pertaining to the program-

1. `index.html` : The main homepage template for rendering the app's front-end.
2. `styles.css` : The primary CSS file for styling the app's user interface. 
3. `script.js` : JavaScript file for managing front-end logic, event listeners, and dynamic functionality.
4. `app.py` : The main Flask application file handling routing, backend logic, and interactions with the database.
5. `helpers.py` : Module containing auxiliary functions to support the main logic in *app.py*.
6. `project.db` : SQLite database storing all the application's data.



## Design Choices

- I chose SQLite as database for this project due to its simplicity and popularity for small-scale applications. A bit of research provided me with the necessary knowledge to manage the database, including opening and closing the connection, inserting and deleting records etc.
- Initially I wrote most of the JavaScript in plain, vanilla JS. However, after discovering jQuery and its ease of use, I began incorporating it into my script.
